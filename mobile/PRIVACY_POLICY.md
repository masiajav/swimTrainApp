# SwimTrainApp Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how SwimTrainApp ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Data we collect

- Profile information: display name and profile photo (if you choose to upload one). If you use the camera to take a photo, the image file is stored locally and uploaded to our server only with your explicit action.
- Usage data: anonymous telemetry and crash reports to help us improve the app.

## Camera and Photos

SwimTrainApp uses the device camera only to allow users to take a profile/avatar photo. We request camera permission to enable this feature. The camera is not used for any other purpose.

If you take a photo using the app, the image may be uploaded to our servers to store as your profile picture. You can delete or replace your profile picture at any time in the app settings.

## How we use data

We use the collected data to:

- Provide and maintain our service (e.g., team session tracking, profile photos).
- Improve and personalize your experience.
- Communicate with you about the app when necessary.

## Data sharing

We do not sell personal data. We may share anonymized usage data with third-party analytics services.

## Your choices

- You can decline to grant camera permission. In that case, you won't be able to take photos in-app, but other features will continue to work.
- You can remove your profile photo at any time via the app settings.
