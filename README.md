# SwimTrainApp 🏊‍♀️

A free and open-source swimming training tracker for mobile and web platforms.

## 🚀 Current Status: **PRODUCTION READY v1.0** (partial)

SwimTrainApp is functional and most core features are implemented. Current dev notes:

- Android: app is executable and testable on Android emulators / devices (verified).
-- Google OAuth on mobile: deferred for MVP. We've disabled Google sign-in in the mobile UI for the initial release because redirect/callback behavior was unreliable in some environments. Use email/password login for now.
- iOS: not tested in this branch yet.

Please see SETUP.md for details on testing on Android and the `dev-login` endpoint to bypass auth during development.
